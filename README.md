# I Forked This Library From [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview.git)

When we create an application and require media input, sometimes there are some conditions that do not allow users to take media from the gallery and only allow the option to take pictures directly from the camera as an evidence of something.

So here I made a few changes to the RNCWebviewModule.java so that the input files in my webview will only open the camera and remove the "select from gallery" option.
